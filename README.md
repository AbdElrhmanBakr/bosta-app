## Important

Some of the data were missing and I had to assume it so that final result would look like the image in the assessment.
Also for different language I created a file in [container] folder called [LangText.jsx].
Also I used one of the packages tracking details with tracking number [7234258].
API => [https://tracking.bosta.co/shipments/track/7234258]
